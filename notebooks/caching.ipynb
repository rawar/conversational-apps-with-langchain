    "LangChain provides an optional caching layer for large language models (LLMs). It can save you money by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM provider, if you’re often requesting the same completion multiple times. It can speed up your application by reducing the number of API calls you make to the LLM provider. For more information about LangChains caching capabilities please have a look [here](https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/llms/llm_caching) "
